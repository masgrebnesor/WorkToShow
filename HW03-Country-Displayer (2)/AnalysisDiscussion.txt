When looking at only the top 10 CO2 emitting countries in graphical form, there doens't seem to be a lot of correlation between some of the information. Protected area for instance, seems like it could be in line with country's ecological priorities, however, Bahrain has bever little protection, whereas Brunei Darussalam has around 10 times the % of protected land, but both places have nearly identical levels of carbon dioxide emissions. The general trend of carbon emissions looks to be very right skewed. There are a handful of countries with very high levels of emissions, then most of the countries grouped around lower levels of CO2. This is interesting as it suggests that only a handful of countries are responsible for an outsized effect of the general emissions by the entire world. Countries with large quantities of population growth also exhibit very large population growth in urban areas, often exceeding the general percentage of the total population growth specifically in the urban areas. This leads to the conclusion that most contries grown in urban areas (or have rual areas urbanize) as a conduit for population growth.
