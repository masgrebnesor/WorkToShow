I talked with my group about the ways in which they planned on tackling the issues. I also discussed my plan to use a map instead of variable names, and asked what they thought about such a choice given the problem.

For some reason repl.it started repeatedly running my code with no input from me. My code was entirely completed so I won't worry about it now, but if there's something I should change let me know.
